# Object-oriented
School course Object oriented programming with python.
The project was a yatzy game running in terminal.
The code is kinda cramped into a single file so it could be more organized into modules, but it works as intended!

A fun project that lasted a couple of weeks and I did manage to capture the spirit of Yatzy into this game.
